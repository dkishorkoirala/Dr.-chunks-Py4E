most common name?

many counters with a dictionary

>>>ccc = dist()
>>>ccc['csev']=1
>>>ccc['cwen']=1
>>>print(ccc)
{'csev': 1, 'cwen': 1}
>>>ccc['cewn'] = ccc['cwen'] + 1
>>>print (ccc)
{'csev': 1, 'cwen': 2}

dictionary tracebacks
we cant look for the key that doesn't exist

but can be solved using in operator
>>> ccc = dict()
>>> print(ccc['csev'])
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
KeyError: 'csev'
>>> 'csev' in ccc #check can solve is also an question
False

when we see a new name
counts = dict()
names = ['csev', 'cwen', 'csev', 'zqian', 'cwen']
for name in names :
    if name not in counts: 
       counts[name] = 1
    else :
        counts[name] = counts[name] + 1
print(counts)

get method for Dictionaries

    if name in counts:
       x = counts[name]
    else :
       x = 0

x = counts.get(name, 0) # get function with argument key and 0 as value of count

{'csev': 2, 'cwen': 2 , 'zqian': 1}

simplified counting with get()

counts = dict()
names = ['csev', 'cwen', 'csev', 'zqian', 'cwen']
for name in names :
    counts[name] = counts.get(name, 0) + 1
print(counts)
