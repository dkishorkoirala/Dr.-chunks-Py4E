if statement and if is reserved word
if (condition):
    print('sjj')
if (condition):
    print('skhf')
print('shf')

comparision operations to ask the questions 
< less than
<= less than or equal to
== is equal to
>= greater than or equal to
> greater than
!= not equal to

x = 5
if x ==5:
    print('Equal to 5')

if x >4: 
    print('Greater than 4')

if x>=5:
    print('Greater than or equals 5')

if x<6 : print('less than 6 ')

if x <= 5: 
    print('Less than or equals 5')

if x!= 6:
    print('Not equals to 6')

remember the indentation

one - way direction till the condition is true it follows excapes if next condition is false


nested block
check the indentation too
eg
x = 5
if x> 2
    print('Bigger than 2')
    print('still bigger')
print('Done with 2')

#loop
for i in range (5):
    print(i)
    if i > 2:
        print('Bigger than 2')
    print('done with i', i)
print('all done')

always check the shape and structure using indentation

two way decision
if -then else
as one or another its like either or
eg
x = 4
if x>2 :
    print('Bigger')
else:
    print('smaller')

print('all done')
