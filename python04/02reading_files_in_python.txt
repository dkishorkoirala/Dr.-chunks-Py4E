File handle as a sequence

xfile = open('mbox.txt') #xfile is handle as a sequence and get to each lines
for line in xfile: #for each line in xfile print each line
    print(line)

counting lines in a file
fhand = open('mbox.txt')
count = 0
for line in fhand:
    count = count + 1
print('line count: ', count)

reading the whole file
>>>fhand= open('mbox-short.txt')
>>>inp= fhand.read()
>>>print(len(inp))
94626
>>>print(inp[:20])
From Stephen.marquar

searching through a file
fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in fhand:
    if line.startswith('From:'):
        print(line)

#prefix used From

file has new lines and for loop wont throw the newline and continues

print creates new line too

searching trhrough a file(fixed)
fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in fhand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if line.startswith('From:'):
        print(line)
here rstrip() is used to remove anything that has no space at the end of the line or right side


skipping with continue
fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in fhand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if not line.startswith('From:'):
        continue
    print(line)
two ways of doing exact same task

using in to select lines
fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in fhand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if not '@uct.ac.za' in line:
        continue
    print(line)

prints all the line having @uct.ac.za

prompt for file name
fname = input('Enter the filename: ')
fhand = open(fname)
count = 0
for line in fhand:
    if line.startswith('Subject:'):
        count = count + 1
print('There were', count, 'subject lines in', fname)

bad file names
fname = input('Enter the filename: ')
try:
    fhand = open(fname)
except:
    print('File cannot be opened:', fname)
    quit()

count = 0
for line in fhand:
    if line.startswith('Subject:'):
        count = count + 1
print('There were', count, 'subject lines in', fname)

summary
secondary storage
opening a file - file handle
File structure - new line character
reading a file line by line with a for loop
searching for lines
reading file names
dealing with bad files
