fixed values are numbers,letters, and strings are called constants

reserved words are special words with special meaning

variables are ones which allocate the values

we assign the variables 

e.g. x=12.2
    y= 14

x = 12.2
y = 14
x = 100 

we rewrite and the leatest value of x on the above case is 100 as leatest value

variable name rules
it starts with letters or underscores
must consist of letters, numbers and underscores
case sensitive

mnemonic variables names
mnemonic = memory aid

xafdfk = 35.0
lhkfkhf = 12.50
sdfas = xafdfk * lhkfkhf
print(sdfas)

a=35.0
b=12.50
c=a*b
print(c)

hours = 35.0
rate = 12.50
pay = hours * rate
print(pay)

python doesnot care about the variables name just thing is operation and calculations only

x = 2 <- assignment statement
x = x+2 <-assigmnent with expression
print(x) <- print statement

assigmnent statement
means = and entire on right side assigns over right side and viceversa

x = 3.9 * x (1-x)
it solves right hand side and take care as new value of new x
